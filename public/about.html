<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hello, my name is Genesis Avila. I was born and raised in Rosemead, California. I'm 21 years old. I'm unsure as to who will be reading this.

  But I hope this short 'about me' paragraph amuses you. Yet, I have nothing else to write about. I'm a plain Jane.
   I like to read, I collect band shirts, I love spending time with my family, and I love cats.

  Ironic because I will probably end up as the town's crazy cat lady. I'm also a phlebotomist- or was. Well, I'm still certified and was good at it, but I realized it wasn't for me.

  I didn't see a challenge in the art of drawing blood. So I decided to join Amazon's Career Choice program. They offered a variety of partnered trade schools, so I chose one and enrolled in a Software Engineering course(this is not a sponsored ad).

  Now I feel that challenge I've been looking for. Maybe a little too much, but it's there. So, again, whoever is reading this- future employer, co-worker, best friend, neighbor, mom, or cat- please send me open job positions. Thank you</p>
